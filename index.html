Stepping Stone Psychology was started to provide a safe and accepting space to share your experiences without judgement and grow through your challenges.
Our experience focuses on providing support to individuals, particularly for adolescents and young adults.

 <br>  
If you are seeking support for your child, we can offer comprehensive support. <b>Individual support</b> for your child, <b>parent support</b> for yourself for any parenting questions that may arise, as well as <b>connecting and collaborating with other professionals</b> in your child’s life.

 <h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
    
<p class="approach">
    Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or CBT, is used successfully all over the world. It has been proven to be effective in treating a variety of psychological complaints and can be tailored to each client’s needs. Negative thoughts and unhealthy behaviour are examples of common and concerning symptoms that can be managed thanks to CBT. It is based on the simple concept that our thoughts, emotions and behaviour are all linked. Changing or adapting your thoughts, can therefore lead to positive changes in both your emotions and behaviour.  
   <br>
   <br>
   Sessions can also include techniques from other approaches, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) or Solution-Focused Therapy (SFT), but above all they will be guided by the needs of the client.

<br>
Originally from Bologna, Italy, I have spent most of my life in South Africa, where I experienced a different way of life compared to my Italian culture. These experiences enriched my perspective of life and led me to pursue Psychology at the University of Cape Town. My first two degrees cemented my passion for learning, particularly about the human mind and behaviour. I continued this journey by emigrating to the Netherlands to strengthen my knowledge and practice in this field.
<br>
<br>
As an expat myself, and having worked with children and adults of all cultures and backgrounds during my studies, I am familiar with the challenges of migration and acculturation. I have worked as a counsellor, coach and psychologist for children and adolescents, and have run various therapy groups and workshops. My work experiences and established education fuel my passion for better mental health for all. My goal is to empower my clients in their journey through life.
